# WindgapMigration
Sample code for simulating wind-gap migration along a valley with confluences. This folder contains example MATLAB code for simulations of wind-gap migration that produce the results shown in Shelef and Goren, The rate and extent of wind-gap:migration regulated by tributary confluences and avulsions, Esurf, 2021.  
To run the code:
1. Have the content of this folder in your “current folder” in MATLAB. 
2. Open the main _s0.m file, and run it section by section.
